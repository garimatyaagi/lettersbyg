excerpt: "On original content, AI, and why I'm starting this blog."
---

I'm starting this blog because I crave more original content in a world that's increasingly filled with recycled takes and AI-generated noise.

We live in an era where AI can generate thousands of mediocre articles in seconds. The response from the internet? More hot takes, more opinions, more content. But not necessarily more *thinking*.

What's missing is original thought—the kind that comes from lived experience, real struggle, and genuine curiosity. The kind that takes time to develop.

## Why Long-Form

I'm committing to long-form writing because:

**Clarity** – I can't think clearly in 280 characters or a five-minute YouTube video. I need space to develop ideas, challenge myself, and actually say something worth saying.

**Depth** – The interesting stuff isn't on the surface. It requires sitting with a problem, looking at it from multiple angles, and working through the nuance.

**Permanence** – In a world of ephemeral content, there's something valuable about writing that might still be relevant (or interesting) a year from now.

**Connection** – Real writing creates real connection. Not engagement metrics—actual resonance with people who think deeply about similar problems.

## What You'll Find Here

I'll be writing about:
- Building and scaling startups
- Business strategy and operations
- The startup mindset and what it actually takes
- Career paths and finding what energizes you
- Learning from failure and pivots
- Life lessons from a non-linear career

I'm not here to have all the answers. I'm here to think out loud, share what I've learned, and hopefully spark something in you—whether that's a new perspective, a tough question, or just the comfort of knowing someone else has wrestled with the same thing.

This is my space for original thinking. I hope you'll read and think along with me.
