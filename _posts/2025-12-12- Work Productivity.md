excerpt: What 50+ user calls taught us about work management - and why we built Oyester
---
Over the last few months, we ran a large number of user conversations to understand a deceptively simple question:

**Why does “work management” still feel painful even after Asana, Jira, Notion, Slack, and a dozen other tools?**

Oyester started as an attempt to answer that. We explored an AI-native work management system that could reduce manual task upkeep, improve visibility, and remove the constant overhead of coordination.

We’re not building Oyester anymore — but the research was valuable enough that it’s worth documenting. This is a synthesis of the patterns that showed up repeatedly across user calls, not a list of feature ideas.

## The core problem wasn’t task management. It was “execution friction.”

Most teams we spoke to didn’t say they lacked tools.

They said something closer to:

- “We have tools, but no one keeps them updated.”
    
- “We don’t know what’s actually happening until it’s too late.”
    
- “Half of management is chasing updates.”
    
- “The cost of coordination keeps increasing as the team grows.”
    

So the pain wasn’t **creating tasks**.

It was everything around tasks:

- capturing work from messy channels
    
- translating it into ownership + deadlines
    
- ensuring follow-through
    
- preventing work from disappearing
    
- maintaining visibility without constant manual updates
    

We started calling this **execution friction** — the invisible tax teams pay to keep work moving.

## Insight #1: Work entered the system from everywhere — and died in the gaps

One recurring theme: teams didn’t have a “source of truth.”

Work showed up through:

- WhatsApp threads
    
- Slack pings
    
- meeting notes
    
- random voice calls
    
- hallway conversations (or their remote equivalents)
    
- emails, forwards, screenshots
    

Then it either:

- never got logged,
    
- got logged but never updated,
    
- or got lost between tools (“it’s in Slack”, “it’s in Notion”, “it’s in someone’s head”).
    

The result was a phenomenon we heard in many forms:

**the “black hole” problem — tasks disappear between intent and execution.**

## Insight #2: Managers weren’t asking for more data — they were asking for fewer surprises

“Visibility” is often described like a reporting problem. In reality, it surfaced as an emotional one.

Managers repeatedly described:

- anxiety about not knowing what’s going on
    
- fear of missing something critical
    
- frustration at finding out late
    
- the need to “check in” constantly just to feel safe
    

This wasn’t because they wanted to micromanage.

It was because they were operating with incomplete signals.

We started framing it as **manager blindness**:  
when the system doesn’t naturally surface risk until it becomes a fire.

---

## Insight #3: Status updates were not “work.” But they consumed an absurd amount of work.

Almost every team had a form of “update ritual”:

- daily standups
    
- weekly reviews
    
- Friday status docs
    
- sprint planning
    
- manager 1:1s
    
- client update threads
    

People didn’t hate updates because they were lazy.

They hated updates because:

- writing them felt like redoing work
    
- tools demanded structured input that didn’t match how work happened
    
- maintaining tools became a second job
    
- and the “admin layer” scaled faster than the team did
    

This was the **admin tax** — coordination overhead that compounds with growth.

---

## Insight #4: Tool fatigue was real — and it wasn’t about too many tools, it was about too many obligations

Many teams were already using:

- Slack/WhatsApp for communication
    
- Asana/Jira/ClickUp for tracking
    
- Notion/Confluence for documentation
    
- Google Docs/Sheets for planning
    
- Calendar + email for scheduling
    

The complaint wasn’t “too many tools exist.”

It was:

- “Every tool demands upkeep.”
    
- “Every tool creates a new place to check.”
    
- “We spend time maintaining systems instead of doing the work.”
    

So adoption failure was predictable:

- leaders tried to implement process,
    
- the team complied for a week,
    
- upkeep dropped,
    
- the tool became stale,
    
- and everyone returned to chat + memory.
    

This wasn’t a product problem. It was a behavior + incentives problem.

## Insight #5: The best teams didn’t have better tools — they had better “default flows”

What separated high-performing teams wasn’t “what tool they used.”

It was whether the system made the right thing the easiest thing.

Examples of “better defaults” we observed:

- clear ownership norms (“every task has an owner, always”)
    
- explicit priority visibility (“what matters this week is obvious”)
    
- lightweight check-in loops that didn’t feel performative
    
- a culture where task capture happened naturally (not as an extra step)
    

So the real wedge wasn’t building a better Asana.

It was reducing friction so the system stayed true _without_ effort.

## Insight #6: AI skepticism wasn’t about capability — it was about trust and control

When we brought up automation, responses split into two camps:

1. **Excited**: “If it can remove admin, I’m in.”
    
2. **Suspicious**: “If it creates wrong tasks or misses context, it’s worse than useless.”
    

The skepticism was less about “AI can’t do it.”

It was about:

- who is accountable when AI is wrong
    
- whether the AI understands context, nuance, and constraints
    
- whether it creates work instead of reducing it
    

Teams didn’t want AI making decisions in the dark.

They wanted AI that:

- captures context,
    
- suggests actions,
    
- and stays auditable.

## What this changed in how we thought about the product

Oyester began as “AI-native work management.”

Over time, the research pulled us toward a more specific framing:

**teams didn’t need a tool to track work — they needed a system that prevented work from slipping.**

The value wasn’t a prettier task list.

The value was:

- catching work that never got captured
    
- surfacing risk early
    
- reducing coordination load
    
- and making execution behavior automatic by default

## The bigger takeaway

Work management is one of those spaces where feature checklists are misleading.

Most tools already do the “management” part.

The market gap lived in the unglamorous layer between:  
**“we agreed to do this”** and **“it actually got done.”**

That layer is where:

- coordination breaks,
    
- accountability becomes personal,
    
- and time gets burned silently.
    

Even though we stopped building Oyester, the research convinced us of one enduring truth:

**execution isn’t a planning problem — it’s a systems problem.**
