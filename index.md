## Welcome

I'm a builder and operator exploring startups, strategy, and how to create meaningful impact.

**Currently:** Co-Founder at Stealth (Nov 2025 - Present)

**Recently:** Founded Littlewise, an EdTech venture (Jul - Oct 2025)

**Before that:** Led PnL at MyMuse India as Head of Business, where I scaled revenue 2x and reduced costs 2x. Learned deeply about consumer businesses and category creation.

I'm passionate about building, learning through doing, and sharing what I've learned along the way. My journey has taken me from banking to startups to social impact—each experience shaped how I think about building and leading today.
