I am a mix of the places I have been to, people I have met, family I was born into, and things that I have done. I haven't yet assigned weights to which of these is more important than the other. 
  
I grew up in a joint family where I was privileged to be loved by my grandparents, my uncle aunt along with my parents. I don't think i can still differentiate between my grandparents and parents and consider myself to be extremely fortunate to have so many people who love me more than life. I still struggle with expressing how I feel about them to them, and the day I'll be able to do that comfortably would be a second phase of life.

I have been an extremely socially awkward person and through my life have enjoyed one on one friendships- but very deep friendships- more than group settings. This started breaking down as I grew up and realised that there were so many interesting people I was missing out talking to. I try now to be more active and I love getting to know people more. However, I still prefer one on one deep talks over anything else. 

I don't remember my take on career while growing up, but I co relate it with impact now. If I can do good work, have fun doing that, and do with it great people that would be time well spent. I also think of career as a more non linear trajectory now so I try to do things I like and don't micro plan it as I used to anymore. With the help of people I surrounded myself with, and the work I was able to do, I was able to build some self belief- which has made me more prone to taking risks. I have worked across public policy, investment banking, startups but I think my exploration phase is just getting started. You can find more on my Linkedin about the exact roles and organisations.

I grew up thinking that I would want to stay in the place I was born at- Delhi. However, that has changed over time. Every city is different just like every person. I want to experience as many different cities and cultures as I can now. This becomes difficult to do with work and other things but I hope the execution of this goal accelerates with time.
