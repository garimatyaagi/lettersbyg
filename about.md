# About Me

I'm a builder exploring the intersection of business, startups, and impact.

## Current Work
**Co-Founder at Stealth** (Nov 2025 - Present) – Building something new in edtech.

## Career Journey

**Littlewise** (Founder, Jul - Oct 2025)
Short but intense journey building an EdTech product.

**MyMuse India** (Head of Business, Apr 2024 - Jul 2025)
Led the company PnL, increased revenue 2x and reduced costs 2x. Learned a lot about consumer businesses and category creation.

**Chief of Staff → Founders Office Finance** (Sep 2023 - Aug 2023)
As the #2 business hire, I did a bit of everything—from investor relations to logistics. No work was beneath me. This is where I learned the startup mindset: the mix between logic and optimism, and how to reframe challenges as opportunities.

**R.E.A.L. - Racial Equality for Arbitration Lawyers** (Director, May 2020 - Jun 2023)
Worked on racial equity in the legal profession.

**Goldman Sachs** (Investment Banking Analyst, Apr 2021 - Jun 2022)
A role I worked incredibly hard to get—only to realize core finance wasn't for me. But I found great mentors and learned that life is too short to do something you're not having an absolute blast doing.

**180 Degrees Consulting DRC** (Founder, Jul 2019 - Jul 2021)
Founded an all-women social sector consulting branch on campus to give students hands-on project experience.

**Harvard University** (Nov 2020 - Apr 2021)
Researched effects of COVID on marginalized communities. Conducted interviews with people in low-income groups—a deeply educational experience that taught me the value of listening and getting work done.

**Early Internships** (2017 - 2020)
Niti Aayog, NSE, BDO, Axis Capital, EY—explored economics, accounting, finance, and consulting before finding my path.

## What I've Learned

I've changed careers more times than I can count. Each pivot taught me something new. The common thread: I'm most energized when building something, learning something, or solving a real problem. I've learned to trust that impulse.
